Notes
  "One set of problems share the following general character:
  given an opinionated piece of text, wherein it is assumed that the overall opin-ion in it is about one single issue or item,
  classify the opinion as falling under one of two opposing sentiment polarities,
  or locate its position on the continuum between these two polarities. "
  "sentiment polarity classification or polarity classification"

  "Grefenstette et al. [112] experimented with determining the political orientation of websites essentially by classifying the concate-nation
   of all the documents found on that site. We group this type of work under the heading of “viewpoints and perspectives,”
   and include under this rubric work on classifying texts as liberal, conservative, lib-ertarian,
   etc. [219], placing texts along an ideological scale [178, 202],or representing Israeli versus Palestinian viewpoints [186, 187]."

"the accuracy of sentiment classification can be influenced by topic. Read [249] finds standard machine learning techniques for opinion analysis
 to be both domain-dependent (with domains ranging from movie reviews to newswire articles) and temporally dependent
  (based on datasets spanning different ranges of time periods but written at least one year apart)."

134  M. Hurst and K. Nigam,
“Retrieving topical sentiments from online document collections

  "One  approach  to  integrating  sentiment  and  topic  when  one  is looking for opinionated documents on a particular user-specified topic  is to
  simply first perform one analysis pass, say for topic, and  then ana-lyze the results with respect to sentiment [134].
  (See Sebastiani [263]for a survey of machine learning approaches to topic-based text catego-rization.)
  Such a two-pass approach was taken by a number of systems at the TREC Blog track in 2006, according to Ounis et al. [227], andothers [234].
  Alternatively, one may jointly model topic and sentiment simultaneously [84, 206], or treat one as a prior for the other [85]."


"As is well known, opinions matter a great deal in politics. Some work has focused on understanding what voters are thinking [83, 110,126, 178, 219], whereas other projects have as a long term goal the clar-ification of politicians’ positions, such as what public figures support oroppose, to enhance the quality of information that voters have accessto [27, 111, 294].Sentiment analysis has specifically been proposed as a key enablingtechnology in eRulemaking, allowing the automatic analysis of the opin-ions that people submit about pending policy or government-regulation proposals [50, 175, 271]"
