Bias is the algorithms tendency to consistently learn the wrong thing by not taking
into account all the information in the data
High Bias is a result of the algorithm missing the relevant relations between features
and target outputs
Underfitting occurs when the algorithm misses to capture the underlying trend of the data
(That happens when a model that is too simple,with high bias and low variance)

Variance refers to an algorithm's sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training set
High Variance is a result of the algorithm fitting to  random noise in the training data

Overfitting occurs when an algorithm fits to closely to a limited set of data
